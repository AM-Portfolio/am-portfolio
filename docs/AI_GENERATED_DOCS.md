# Overview of the Codebase
The AM-Portfolio codebase is a web application designed to showcase a personal portfolio. It is built using a RESTful API architecture, with a focus on providing a scalable and maintainable solution. The codebase is written in a modular fashion, with separate components handling different aspects of the application.

## Key Components and their Purposes
The key components of the codebase are:

* **Controller Class**: This class handles incoming HTTP requests and sends responses back to the client. It acts as an intermediary between the client and the business logic of the application.
* **API Endpoints**: These are the entry points for the API, defining the available actions that can be performed on the application. Each endpoint is associated with a specific HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and a specific URL path.
* **Business Logic**: This component contains the core logic of the application, responsible for processing requests and generating responses. It interacts with the database and other external services to perform its tasks.
* **Database**: This component stores and retrieves data for the application. It provides a centralized repository for all data related to the portfolio.

## API Documentation
The API documentation provides a detailed description of the available endpoints, including their URLs, HTTP methods, request and response formats, and any applicable parameters or query strings.

### Endpoints
The following endpoints are available:

#### GET /portfolio
* **Description**: Retrieves a list of all portfolio items.
* **Request**: None
* **Response**: A JSON array of portfolio items, each containing `id`, `title`, `description`, and `image` properties.
* **Example Response**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Project 1",
    "description": "This is a description of project 1",
    "image": "https://example.com/image1.jpg"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Project 2",
    "description": "This is a description of project 2",
    "image": "https://example.com/image2.jpg"
  }
]
```

#### GET /portfolio/{id}
* **Description**: Retrieves a single portfolio item by ID.
* **Request**: `id` parameter in the URL path
* **Response**: A JSON object containing the portfolio item's `id`, `title`, `description`, and `image` properties.
* **Example Response**:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Project 1",
  "description": "This is a description of project 1",
  "image": "https://example.com/image1.jpg"
}
```

#### POST /portfolio
* **Description**: Creates a new portfolio item.
* **Request**: A JSON object containing the `title`, `description`, and `image` properties.
* **Response**: A JSON object containing the newly created portfolio item's `id`, `title`, `description`, and `image` properties.
* **Example Request**:
```json
{
  "title": "New Project",
  "description": "This is a description of the new project",
  "image": "https://example.com/newimage.jpg"
}
```
* **Example Response**:
```json
{
  "id": 3,
  "title": "New Project",
  "description": "This is a description of the new project",
  "image": "https://example.com/newimage.jpg"
}
```

### Controller Class
The controller class is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and sending responses back to the client. It uses the business logic component to process requests and generate responses.

```java
// ControllerClass.java
public class ControllerClass {
  private BusinessLogic businessLogic;

  public ControllerClass(BusinessLogic businessLogic) {
    this.businessLogic = businessLogic;
  }

  public Response getPortfolio() {
    List<PortfolioItem> portfolioItems = businessLogic.getPortfolioItems();
    return Response.ok(portfolioItems).build();
  }

  public Response getPortfolioItem(int id) {
    PortfolioItem portfolioItem = businessLogic.getPortfolioItem(id);
    return Response.ok(portfolioItem).build();
  }

  public Response createPortfolioItem(PortfolioItem portfolioItem) {
    businessLogic.createPortfolioItem(portfolioItem);
    return Response.created(UriBuilder.fromResource(ControllerClass.class).path(String.valueOf(portfolioItem.getId())).build()).build();
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples
To use the API, simply send an HTTP request to the desired endpoint. For example, to retrieve a list of all portfolio items, send a GET request to `http://example.com/portfolio`.

```bash
curl -X GET http://example.com/portfolio
```

To create a new portfolio item, send a POST request to `http://example.com/portfolio` with a JSON object containing the `title`, `description`, and `image` properties.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "New Project", "description": "This is a description of the new project", "image": "https://example.com/newimage.jpg"}' http://example.com/portfolio
```

## Architecture Notes
The codebase uses a RESTful API architecture, with a focus on providing a scalable and maintainable solution. The controller class acts as an intermediary between the client and the business logic, handling incoming HTTP requests and sending responses back to the client. The business logic component contains the core logic of the application, responsible for processing requests and generating responses. The database provides a centralized repository for all data related to the portfolio.

The codebase is written in a modular fashion, with separate components handling different aspects of the application. This allows for easy maintenance and updates, as well as scalability to meet the needs of a growing application.

Overall, the AM-Portfolio codebase provides a robust and scalable solution for showcasing a personal portfolio. Its modular architecture and RESTful API design make it easy to maintain and update, while its focus on scalability ensures that it can meet the needs of a growing application.
