Authentication Documentation
==========================
### Overview of the Codebase

The codebase is a Java-based portfolio application that utilizes various technologies such as Redis, Kafka, and MongoDB. The application is designed to manage and analyze portfolio data, including stock prices, market indices, and portfolio holdings. The codebase is divided into two main modules: `portfolio-redis` and `portfolio-app`.

### Key Components and their Purposes

*   **RedisConfig**: This is a configuration class that sets up the Redis connection and caching mechanism for the application. It defines the Redis host, password, and cache time-to-live (TTL) settings.
*   **application.yml**: This is a configuration file that contains settings for the application, including MongoDB, Kafka, and Redis connections. It also defines various properties such as topic names, consumer IDs, and security settings.
*   **RedisConnectionFactory**: This is a bean that creates a Redis connection factory, which is used to establish connections to the Redis server.
*   **RedisTemplate**: This is a bean that creates a Redis template, which is used to perform operations on the Redis cache.

### API Documentation

The codebase does not provide a RESTful API for authentication. However, it does provide a configuration class `RedisConfig` that sets up the Redis connection and caching mechanism.

#### RedisConfig API

*   **redisConnectionFactory()**: This method creates a Redis connection factory, which is used to establish connections to the Redis server.
*   **redisTemplate()**: This method creates a Redis template, which is used to perform operations on the Redis cache.

### Usage Examples

To use the Redis configuration in the application, you can inject the `RedisTemplate` bean into your service classes and use it to perform operations on the Redis cache.

```java
@Service
public class PortfolioService {
    
    @Autowired
    private RedisTemplate<String, String> redisTemplate;
    
    public void savePortfolioData(String data) {
        redisTemplate.opsForValue().set("portfolio:data", data);
    }
    
    public String getPortfolioData() {
        return redisTemplate.opsForValue().get("portfolio:data");
    }
}
```

### Architecture Notes

The application uses a microservices architecture, with separate modules for Redis configuration and portfolio data management. The Redis configuration module provides a centralized configuration for the Redis connection and caching mechanism, while the portfolio data management module uses the Redis template to perform operations on the Redis cache.

The application also uses a configuration file `application.yml` to define various properties such as topic names, consumer IDs, and security settings. This file is used to configure the application and its dependencies.

### Security Considerations

The application uses a Redis password to secure the Redis connection. The password is defined in the `application.yml` file and is used to authenticate the Redis connection.

The application also uses Kafka security features such as SASL_PLAINTEXT and SSL encryption to secure the Kafka connection.

### Best Practices

The application follows best practices such as:

*   Using a centralized configuration file `application.yml` to define various properties and settings.
*   Using a Redis connection factory and template to perform operations on the Redis cache.
*   Using Kafka security features to secure the Kafka connection.
*   Using a microservices architecture to separate concerns and improve scalability.

### Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues with the application, you can check the following:

*   Redis connection logs to ensure that the Redis connection is established successfully.
*   Kafka connection logs to ensure that the Kafka connection is established successfully.
*   Application logs to ensure that the application is functioning correctly.

You can also use tools such as Redis CLI and Kafka CLI to troubleshoot issues with the Redis and Kafka connections.

### Future Development

Future development plans for the application include:

*   Adding more features to the portfolio data management module.
*   Improving the security and scalability of the application.
*   Adding more microservices to the application to separate concerns and improve scalability.

### Code Examples

Here are some code examples that demonstrate how to use the Redis configuration and portfolio data management modules:

```java
// Create a Redis connection factory
RedisConnectionFactory redisConnectionFactory = new LettuceConnectionFactory(new RedisStandaloneConfiguration("localhost", 6379));

// Create a Redis template
RedisTemplate<String, String> redisTemplate = new RedisTemplate<>();
redisTemplate.setConnectionFactory(redisConnectionFactory);

// Save portfolio data to Redis
redisTemplate.opsForValue().set("portfolio:data", "example data");

// Get portfolio data from Redis
String portfolioData = redisTemplate.opsForValue().get("portfolio:data");
```

```java
// Create a portfolio service
@Service
public class PortfolioService {
    
    @Autowired
    private RedisTemplate<String, String> redisTemplate;
    
    public void savePortfolioData(String data) {
        redisTemplate.opsForValue().set("portfolio:data", data);
    }
    
    public String getPortfolioData() {
        return redisTemplate.opsForValue().get("portfolio:data");
    }
}
```

```java
// Create a Kafka producer
KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);

// Send a message to Kafka
producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("example_topic", "example_message"));
```

```java
// Create a Kafka consumer
KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);

// Subscribe to a topic
consumer.subscribe(Collections.singleton("example_topic"));

// Poll for messages
while (true) {
    ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(100);
    for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
        System.out.println(record.value());
    }
}
```
